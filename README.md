# ShoppingListIA**Note**: This Interface Asset is available for all Intuiface supported Platforms. The Shopping List Interface Asset (Shopping List IA) enables you to add and remove priced items from a list. When the user finishes shopping, the interface asset can also create an email body or a JSON object containing the list. You can use this email body with the [Share via Email Interface Asset](https://support.intuiface.com/hc/en-us/articles/360007430911-Interface-Asset-Share-via-Email), or send your JSON body to a third-party system through a web service.
